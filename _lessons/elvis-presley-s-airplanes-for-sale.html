<p>January 8 is the birthday of American rock and roll <strong>legend</strong> Elvis Presley. He would have turned 80 years old on January 8. But, he died 1977 at the still young age of 42.</p>
<p>Elvis <strong>mania</strong> is still widespread in America. People go to shows featuring Elvis look-a-likes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hundreds of thousands go to Memphis, Tennessee, each year to visit his home and burial place, Graceland.</p>
<p>People also get excited about Elvis <strong>memorabilia</strong> -- his belongings, objects he touched, any of his writings and other things related to the man called the King of Rock and Roll.</p>
<p>On Friday, someone might get a huge piece of Elvis history.</p>
<p>On that day, the company Julien's Auctions will hold a special sale of Elvis Presley’s two airplanes. The special sale is called an auction. That is a public sale where objects are sold to the person or people who offer the most money.</p>
<p>The planes have been on public view at Graceland for 30 years. They are currently not airworthy.</p>
<p>The Lisa Marie was Presley’s first <strong>jet</strong>. It is also the bigger of the two. It could fly up to 28 passengers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presley bought it in 1975 for $250,000. Then he spent $300,000 more on repairs and making the inside beautiful. It has an area for sleeping, a conference room for meetings, and a bar -- a place for making and enjoying alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>The Lisa Marie was named after Presley’s daughter. The plane is rare. There were only 65 of the same kind ever made.</p>
<p>The singer purchased his second jet while waiting for work to be finished on the Lisa Marie. The Hound Dog II could fly eight to 10 passengers.</p>
<p>Julien’s Auctions is based Beverly Hills, California. Officials with the company say they expect the planes to sell for $10 million and $15 million.</p>
<p>The company also says the buyer may purchase land near Graceland to keep and show the jets. An agreement between Graceland and the jets' current owners is set to <strong>expire </strong>at the end of April. The identity of the owners has not been released.</p>

The record shows I took the blows<br>
