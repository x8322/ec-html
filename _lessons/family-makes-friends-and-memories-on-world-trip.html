Many families take their children on vacation. They will usually travel for a few days or weeks during school breaks. But Julie and Tim Rivenbark planned a longer vacation with their two children -- the Rivenbark family is on a one-year trip around the world. They plan to visit 30 countries in all.</p>
<p>Right now, the four travellers are about halfway through their trip. Ms. Rivenbark says they are trying to see as much of the world as they can.</p>
<p>She says “We have been through Europe, southern Africa, now we are kind of working our way through Asia. So we have been to a bunch of big cities, like Dubai, Johannesburg, Rome and Bangkok.”</p>
<p>The family has also spent time floating in <strong>kayaks</strong> in Italy, flying in hot air balloons in Myanmar, <strong>hiking</strong> to the Everest Base Camp in Nepal and going on <strong>safari </strong>in South Africa.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivenbark says the family has also ridden on ostrich birds, elephants, and camels. But, he says, one of the most interesting experiences of the trip has been meeting new people.</p>
<p>“People have been extremely friendly, very welcoming and love our kids -- interacting with them and their reaction to see our kids enjoying themselves in their country."</p>
<p>Eleven-year old Tyler says he has enjoyed learning about the people they have met.</p>
<p>“I learned in Africa that people have very different lifestyles than in America."</p>
<p>His sister, 9-year-old Kara, discovered that she liked Thai food.</p>
<p>Ms. Rivenbark says that the extended trip teaches the children a lot more than short visits would have.</p>
<p>“I think that the longer that we travel, the more <strong>impact</strong> it has on how they see the world. I can see them changing more than they can see themselves.”</p>
<p>It took the family a year to prepare for the trip. They had to sell their house and cars. Ms. Rivenbark quit her job and her husband is using unpaid leave.</p>
<p>They carry small bags filled with lightweight clothing and whatever else they need.</p>
<p>Ms. Rivenbark says she enjoys being able to carry everything she needs on her back. She says she does not miss the things she has back home.</p>
<p>“What has become more important is making these memories as a family and taking those with us instead.”</p>
<p>Tyler and Kara each have iPads so they can communicate with teachers to stay current with their schoolwork. Tyler is also creating a 365-day video blog.</p>
<p>The Rivenbarks will continue to head east for the next six months. They plan to visit Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China and Australia. To follow their adventures, visit their website: <a class="wsw__a" href="features%20on%20desktop%2012-23-14/earthtrekkers.com">earthtrekkers.com</a>. </p>
