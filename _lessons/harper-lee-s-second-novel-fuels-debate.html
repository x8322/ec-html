American writer Harper Lee’s first -- and until now, only -- book, “To Kill a Mockingbird,” is one of America’s best-loved <strong>novels</strong>. The 1960 publication explores racism and injustice in the American South. It was an instant best-seller. Two years later it was awarded a Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>Readers around the world have bought 40 million copies of the book since its release. “To Kill a Mockingbird” also inspired an Oscar-winning movie of the same name.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Harper Lee’s second book “Go Set a Watchman,” was released for sale, 55 years after the first. Lee had announced in February that she would publish a sequel to “To Kill a Mockingbird.”</p>
<p>The new novel became the most pre-ordered book on Amazon.com since the final book in J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series.</p>
<p>Lee wrote “Watchman” in 1957, before she wrote “Mockingbird.” Her editor at the time <strong>encouraged</strong> her to rewrite “Watchman” from the point of view of a child. She agreed. That effort became “To Kill a Mockingbird.”</p>
<p>But so far, Ms. Lee’s second novel has received mixed reviews. It has also led to debate. Some observers are questioning how “Go Set a Watchman” will affect Ms. Lee’s <strong>legacy</strong>, as well as the legacy of “To Kill a Mockingbird.”</p>
<p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> published a preview of the book’s first chapter last Friday. The newspaper described the novel as a “distressing book.” <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> called it “an <strong>apprentice</strong> effort.”</p>
<p>And a U.S. public radio critic said it was “kind of a mess that will forever change the way we read a masterpiece.”</p>
<p>“To Kill a Mockingbird” takes place in the 1930s in a small town in the southern state of Alabama. Six-year-old Scout Finch <strong>narrates</strong> the story. Her father, lawyer Atticus Finch, defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee wrote the character of Atticus as a strong believer in justice. He bravely faces, and fights, deep prejudice and hate among the people in his town.</p>
<p>The story of “Go Set a Watchman,” is set about 20 years after the ending of the first book. An adult Scout returns from New York to visit her father in Alabama.</p>
<p>Some readers are protesting the character of Atticus as he is written in “Go Set a Watchman.” They say he is a racist. And, they say that that is unacceptable.</p>
<p>In a letter to <em>The New York Times</em>, one man wrote, “As a native of Alabama, I had held up Atticus in my own mind as a redemptive figure, a symbol of hope, a hero who was brave enough to fight for what is right despite the poisonous and dangerous pools of racism long associated with whites in the Deep South.”</p>
<p>Others consider this latest version of Atticus good for today’s America. </p>
<p>Harper Lee <strong>biographer</strong> Charles Shields spoke to the New York Times about the book. He said this Atticus could help support a national discussion about racism. He said, “It turns out that Atticus is no saint, as none of us are, but a man with prejudices.”</p>
<p>So far, any <strong>negative</strong> press has not slowed sales of Harper Lee’s work. The number one and two spots on Amazon’s best-seller list are filled by “Go Set a Watchman” and “To Kill a Mockingbird.”</p>
