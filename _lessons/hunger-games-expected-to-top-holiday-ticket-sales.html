<p>The latest movie in “The Hunger Games” series was number one in ticket sales for its opening last weekend. However, it did not make as much as the openings of the other two movies in the series.</p>
<p>The third and latest is called “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1.” It brought in about $123 million in U.S. ticket sales. But the first Hunger Games movie sold $151 million worth of tickets in its 2012 release weekend. And in 2013, the <strong>sequel </strong>“Catching Fire,” made six million above that.</p>
<p>The producers for the Hunger Games series should still be happy. “Mockingjay, Part 1” is actually the third <strong>installment</strong> in the planned four-part movie series. It has outsold every opening weekend so far this year. And worldwide the movie sold another $275 million of tickets.</p>
<p>Gary Susman of Moviefone.com wrote about the smaller <strong>audiences</strong> for “Mockingjay – Part 1.” He suggested that there is often less interest in the second to last film in any series. He wrote that people know the second to last movie will serve as a bridge between the one before it and the last. They do not expect as much action. He thinks some people plan to watch “Mockingjay – Part 1” on video much closer to the release of the final “Hunger Games” next year.</p>
<p>In this installment, lead character Katniss Everdeen becomes involved in the revolution started in District 13. She is torn between her desire to save her nation and her concern for her friend Peeta who is being held by the government. Both characters become involved in opposite propaganda campaigns.</p><div class="clear"></div>

<p>Gary Susman of Moviefone.com also writes that he suspects some people may <strong>skip</strong> Mockingjay-Part 1 because they know there is no Hunger Games competition in the movie. And he notes that the film had strong competition with “Interstellar” and “Big Hero 6” still popular among U.S. theater goers.</p>
<p>Just like “Catching Fire,” “Mockingjay – Part 1” is in its second weekend during the Thanksgiving holiday. Experts predict the movie will top box office sales this weekend also.</p>
