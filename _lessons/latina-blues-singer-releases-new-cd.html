Blues singer Evelyn Rubio has released a new CD that shows her abilities as a singer, songwriter and saxophone player.</p>
<p>Ms. Rubio was born in Mexico but now lives in Houston, Texas, in the southwestern United States.</p>
<p>She sings in English and Spanish.</p>
<p>She plays the saxophone with jazz and blues bands, but she began her career as a singer in Mexico.</p>
<p>“I start my career singing. I have been singing all my life and saxophone came later just for fun.”</p>
<p>She says record companies have shown interest in her music. But she decided to use her own money to make her CD and music video. Because she works independently, she controls what songs she sings. But she must pay for her own photographs, videos and <strong>publicity campaigns</strong>.</p>
<p>“Before, you used to think that somebody is going to discover you. I don’t think it works like that anymore. Well, maybe for some people. But right now, you need to do, as an independent artist, a lot of work.”</p>
<p>She paid a <strong>professional </strong>crew to produce a music video in New York. Many people have watched it on YouTube.</p>
<p>One of her most popular songs is called “Hombres,” the Spanish word for “men.” She says she wrote it to protest the many blues songs that say bad things about men.</p>
<p>“Most of the blues songs that talk about guys, they talk about the bad stuff you know the <strong>cheating</strong>, the running around, the <strong>brawls</strong>, blah, blah, blah. And I really think there are so many good guys out there that they deserve to have a nice song talking about them.”</p>
<p>Evelyn Rubio also recorded her songs in Spanish and produced a separate, Spanish-language CD for Hispanics in the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>She says her kind of music is becoming popular in Mexico.</p>
<p>“Mexicans like and enjoy jazz and blues. Blues is about your soul, about your heart, and everybody can relate with that.”</p>
