Now, the VOA Learning English program, <em>Words and Their Stories.</em></p>
<p>Different people have different ways of saying things – their own special expressions. Each week we tell about some popular American expressions. </p>
<p>What you are listening to is a call for help. It is the Morse code distress signal S.O.S. For years, telegraph operators used Morse code to communicate across the country and around the world.</p>
<p>A skilled operator could send and receive 30 or 40 words a minute. In the language of Morse code, the letter “S” is three short dots and the letter “O” is three longer dashes. Put them together and you have S.O.S.</p>
<p>These sounds represent the international call for help because they are easy to recognize. Now, it is simply known as S.O.S.</p>

<p><small><em>The short video above was cut from an official United States Army instructional video. </em></small></p>
<p>But many people think that S.O.S. stands for “Save Our Ship” or “Save Our Souls.” It does not. S.O.S. has come to mean that because of how we use it – when we need to be saved, as when a ship is sinking.</p>
<p>S.O.S. is an example of a new, if somewhat unofficial, word in the English language. We call it a <strong>backronym</strong>. A backronym is a combination of two words: backward and acronym.</p>
<p>An acronym is an abbreviation, a shorter version of a long word or expression. For example, the word “scuba” is an acronym. It stands for <strong>s</strong>elf-<strong>c</strong>ontained <strong>u</strong>nderwater <strong>b</strong>reathing <strong>a</strong>pparatus. But scuba is so much easier to say!</p>
<p>Backronyms, on the other hand, are built in the opposite way. They are made by creating a phrase or expression for an already existing word or acronym.</p>
<p>For example, the United States Department of Justice recently gave new meaning to its Amber Alert program. Now, Amber officially stands for "<strong>A</strong>merica's <strong>M</strong>issing: <strong>B</strong>roadcast <strong>E</strong>mergency <strong>R</strong>esponse.” But the program was originally named for Amber Hagerman, a nine-year-old girl who was kidnapped and murdered in Texas in 1996.</p>
<p>Sometimes, backronyms come from outdated language. Writing “CC” at the end of a document once meant "carbon copy.” Before computers and email, people would often make a carbon copy of a letter they sent on official business. These days we often send electronic copies of letters by email, not carbon copies. So, “CC” is now a backronym that means “courtesy copy” </p>
<p>Americans often use backronyms as jokes. For example, NASA, the U.S. space agency, named a treadmill on the International Space Station after the television personality Stephen Colbert. The agency created the name “<strong>C</strong>ombined <strong>O</strong>perational<strong> L</strong>oad-<strong>B</strong>earing <strong>E</strong>xternal <strong>R</strong>esistance <strong>T</strong>readmill” to spell out the name COLBERT.</p>
<p>Who says scientists lack a sense of humor?</p>
<p>Do not worry if you have never heard of backronyms. Many Americans have not either. The earliest known use of "backronym" appeared in <em>The Washington Post</em> in 1983.</p>
<p>The newspaper asked readers to send in a new word. Editors picked Meredith G. Williams as the winner with her word, “backronym,” spelled with or without a “k.” She defined backronym, as the "same as an acronym, except that the words were chosen to fit the letters."</p>
<p>And that brings us to the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em> program.</p>
<p>I’m Anna Matteo. </p>
<p>Hmmm, “ANNA” could be a backronym for “<strong>A</strong>nother <strong>N</strong>ewscaster <strong>N</strong>amed <strong>A</strong>nna.”</p><div class="clear"></div>
