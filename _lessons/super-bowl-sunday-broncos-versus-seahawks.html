The Denver Broncos take on the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 48, the first Super Bowl game to be financed by two states. The northeastern states of New York and New Jersey are jointly supporting the game at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.<br>

This is the seventh time the Denver Broncos have been to the Super Bowl. The Colorado team won the championship two times, in 1998 and 1999. That was the last time the team went to the Super Bowl.<br>
