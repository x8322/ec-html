Today, we tell a story of love through song lyrics.<p>It starts with the search for the perfect mate...<p><strong><em>Looking for Love…</em></strong><p>Singer Johnny Lee starts our story with “Lookin’ for Love,” a song from 1980.<p>The words of the song suggest that finding love is not easy. The song goes, <em>looking for love in all the wrong places / looking for love in too many faces. </em>In other words, this man needs to make changes in how and where he searches for a partner.<p>At the end of “Lookin’ For Love,” Johnny Lee sings: <em>and you came knockin' on my heart’s door / you're everything I've been lookin' for</em>.<p>The next song tells how that discovery felt.<p><strong>First Time Ever...</strong><p>You have to be pretty excited about someone if you think the sun rose in his or her eyes, right? Roberta Flack then sings:<p><em>and the moon and the stars / were the gifts you gave / to the dark and the endless skies</em>.<p>The words from “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” express beautifully that magic of new love.<p><strong>Love Will Tear…</strong><p>So, our man and woman are now partners. But love is complex. Love can create tension. The band Joy Division warned about this in a song written in 1979, “Love Will Tear Us Apart<em>.</em>”<p><strong>Let’s Stay Together…</strong><p>In our story today, the man begs his woman not to let it tear them apart and not to break up. Artist Al Green knows just what to sing: “Let’s Stay Together.”<p><strong>Better Together…</strong><p>Since today is Valentine’s Day, we are going to end our story on a positive note. Our lovers do stay together and live “happily ever after.” They are, as musician Jack Johnson sings, “Better Together.”<p>I’m Caty Weaver.<p><p><em>What phrases did you learn from this story about finding and keeping love?
