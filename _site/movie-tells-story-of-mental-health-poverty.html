Instead “Infinitely Polar Bear” tells about an American family and how it reacted to events -- some of them humorous, and others serious -- back in the 1970s.<p>VOA’s Penelope Poulou spoke recently with Maya Forbes about how her childhood struggles helped her become a successful film writer, producer and director.<p><em>Actor Mark Rufallo as Cameron Stuart</em>: “We can go to the Museum of Fine Arts and look at great-grandpapa’s <strong>portrait</strong>.”<p><em>Actress Imogene Wolodarsky as Cameron Stuart’s daughter Amelia</em>: “Why is his portrait hanging in a museum?”<p><em>Mark Rufallo</em>: “Because a very important artist named John Singer Sargent painted it.”<p><em>Imogene Wolodarsky</em>: “Why?”<p><em>Mark Rufallo</em>: “Why? Don’t you know who we are?”<p>Actor Mark Rufallo plays Cameron Stuart, a member of a once-powerful family. His ancestors had a lot of money many years ago, but now the family has very little.<p>Cameron Stuart has a severe mental condition. He suffers from <strong>manic depression</strong>, also known as bipolar disorder.<p>This is how his younger daughter describes the disorder:<p>“Our dad is totally Polar Bear.”<p>Mr. Stuart’s older daughter, Amelia, corrects her sister:<p>“Bipolar.”<p>Maya Forbes used her family’s story as a model for the Stuarts.<p>“My father was manic depressive, my mother is African-American, my father was from a wealthy New England family, but we didn’t have any money. My mother wanted to send us to great schools.”<p><em>Cameron Stuart’s mother Pauline reacts to her son’s wife’s decision to get a job in New York City to support the family</em>: “No, no! Maggie Stuart. You cannot leave your family.”<p><em>Actress Zoe Saldana as Maggie Stuart</em>: “Pauline, I’m desperate. We have no money.”<p>Like Maggie, Maya Forbes’ mother left her husband to care for the children. She went to work in New York City, but visited the family every weekend.<p>“My sister and I were very embarrassed of our situation. We were <strong>ashamed</strong>, I mean<strong>, </strong>my father, we, our apartment was a disaster, a <strong>mess</strong>, my father was <strong>embarrassing</strong> and a mess and he at some point he said to us ‘You don’t need to be, you don't need to hide and you can tell people that I’m manic depressive -- that’s who I am.’”<p>Ms. Forbes says people like her film because mental illness has affected them in some way.<p>“People are coming to share their story with me. And most people are affected by mental illness with somebody they love, whether its a parent of a child or a <strong>sibling</strong>.”<p>Her film also deals with sexual and racial discrimination. Her mother was well-educated. But Ms. Forbes says she could not get a high-paying job in Boston because she was a black woman.<p>“My mother going into the world of finance -- there are not a lot of black women in finance, you know, today. I mean, it's not like we've made huge <strong>strides</strong> in that <strong>arena</strong>. And everyone feels that we, we solved the problems because Obama is our president. We’re post-racial. That is not true.”<p>The director also says that she, like other women, has dealt with sex discrimination in Hollywood.<p>“I don’t know why there aren't more women directors. I just think they aren't <strong>handed </strong>the big movies, they aren't handed the big movies and those are the movies where you can actually make some money.”<p>She says it was not easy making a film while raising a family. But she says her childhood helped her to become independent and strong.<p>I’m Christopher Jones-Cruise.<p><em>VOA Entertainment Correspondent Penelope Poulou reported this story.
