Guess who was number one on the yearly grouping? Queen Bey, of course. Forbes says Beyonce Knowles made 115 million dollars between June of 2013 and 2014.

Her extremely successful 1984 album, “Like A Virgin,” turned 30 on Thursday. The album’s song and linked video, “Material Girl,” was such a major hit that the press often calls Madonna herself, “the Material Girl.”<p>And finally, on Monday, Legacy Records released the first-ever album of live performances from Whitney Houston. The music star died in 2012 at 48 years old. The <strong>legendary</strong> producer, and Houston’s friend, Clive Davis, produced the collection. It includes a CD and a DVD. Davis spoke about the new album during an appearance on the American television program, “The Today Show.” He said the collection shows that she was the greatest singer of her generation.<p>I’m Caty Weaver.<p>______________________________________________________________<h2 class="wsw__h2"><strong>Words in this Story</strong></h2><p><strong>celebrities – </strong><em>n. </em>famous people<p><strong>mega – </strong><em>adj. </em>very popular, successful, or important<p><strong>legendary – </strong><em>adj. </em>very famous or well-known<p><em>Now it’s your turn to use these <strong>Words in This Story</strong>.
