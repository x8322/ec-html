You want to talk about an object, but you forgot the name of it. Or you never knew the name at all. Maybe you are not even sure there is a word for it.<p>For example, that thing that you need to fix your bicycle. Or perhaps it is something you need for your computer. Or that part on your <strong>motorcycle </strong>that never, ever seems to work.<p>What are these things?<p>They are called “<u>doohickies</u>.” A <u>doohickey</u> is a word you use when you do not know, or you have forgotten, the real name of an object.<p><em>The MacMillan Dictionary</em> defines <u>doohickey</u> as “something such as a small object or tool that you cannot remember the name of.” <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>says it is “something, especially a small device or part, whose name is unknown or forgotten.”<p>Language experts say the word first started being used in the United States in the early 1900s. But other experts say they have seen examples of words like these in writings from the middle 1800s.<p><em>The Merriam-Webster Dictionary for Learners of American English</em> gives this example of how native speakers might use <u>doohickey</u>: “I need one of those <u>doohickeys</u>, you know, with the long <strong>handle</strong>.”<p><em>Merriam-Webster</em> adds that <u>doohickey</u> may be a combination of two other words: “<u>doodad</u>” and “<u>hickey</u>.” Strange as it may be, both of these words mean the same as <u>doohickey.</u> The dictionary lists a lot of strange words as <strong>synonyms</strong> for <u>doohickey</u>. The most common are <u>whatchamacallit</u>, <u>whatnot </u>and <u>whatsit.</u><p>You will probably never see these words in official documents or newspaper reports. But you might hear them in <strong>informal </strong>American English, when people are talking to each other.<p>“Hey, what does this <u>doohickey</u> do, anyway?”<p>“Dude, bring me that <u>thingamajig</u>, willya?<p>“Janine, can you get me one of those <u>whatchamacallits</u>?”<p>Most Americans will know what you are talking about if you use one of those words. Just point at the object, use one of these words, and they will bring it to you.<p><u>Doohickey</u> and words like it have their own page on the Wikipedia website. Wikipedia calls them “placeholders.” It says words like these are usually nouns and “can be used for people, objects and places.”<p>Unofficial studies show Americans are using words like <u>doohickey</u> less than they once did. The decline seems to have started a few years ago. Still, a recent search of Google News showed the word was used in more than 1,000 news articles in just a couple months.<p>One story told about a store where you can buy a <strong>cable </strong>that connects a <u>thingamajig</u> to a <u>doohickey</u>. Another told about a <u>doohickey</u> for eggs and even a <u>doohickey</u> that connects to a camera.<p>Workers who repair Kawasaki motorcycles use the word <u>doohickey</u> to describe the vehicle’s “counter balancing chain adjustment mechanism.”<p>You can see a video of them using the word on YouTube.<div class="clear"></div><div class="mediaReplacer externalMedia"><div class="c-sticky-container"><div class="c-sticky-element" data-sp_api="youtube"> <span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close"> <span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span> </span><div class="external-content-placeholder"></div><script>renderExternalContent("https://www.youtube.com/embed/NRr_NS0Oc3k?&&&fs=1")</script></div></div></div><p>​<p>I’m Anna Matteo.
